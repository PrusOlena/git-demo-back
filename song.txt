We are
the champions
my friend
and we'll 
keep on fighting
till the end
we are the champions
we are the champions
no time
for losers
'cause we are the champions
of the World

I've paid my dues
time after time
I've done my sentence
but committed no crime

and had mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand
Kicked in my face
But I've come through

and we mean to go on and on and on and on
